              First of all, we got to know each other when Laura started coming to youth group events and Bible studies after her dad, Andre, moved to Christchurch and became our minister at Dovedale in 2008. James acted as chauffeur on a regular basis, and we spent much time talking and laughing over long car rides! Even before we started going out we did enough together to make the Reformed rumour mill.

              <p align="justify" class="text-girl no-bot-margined"> 
              James taught me how to solve the rubix cube, how to shoot a rifle without actually killing anything, and he came along to most of my singing performances at school. You could say that we were a couple ready for the picking when church camp came along, almost two years ago!

              Laura was the only girl who ended up staying the night at the boys flat as the other girls went home after the boys started gaming on the computers. I felt that it was my real call of duty to make sure that she was not bored, and so I stopped playing Call of Duty early in the night and played cards with Laura and a few others before helping her with the dishes. We talked for several hours, and as I was five months away from departing for the US, she shared her experiences and memories with me from when she staying over there while Andre was at seminary.

              <p align="justify" class="text-girl no-bot-margined"> 
              After bunking on the couches in the dining room, with a glass door between us and the gamers, we talked a bit more before saying goodnight! Not long after that James finally worked up the courage to say "well, I think we both know that we like each other, and..." the next morning he was talking to my dad, who invited him over for dinner the following night! Having the parental permission desired, we decided to go for it and use the remaining four months to get to know each other before James took off for Yale Graduate School.

              Even though three months didn't sound that long, being together was something else and we spent many hours talking and spending time with friends and family. Outside of school and work we had many adventures, with our family moving for two months for earthquake repairs and James working with his brother, Alan, and with many youth group events and outings as well!
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
              Not everything was light hearted, however, as during those months Laura's nana, Ali, passed away on her 18<sup>th</sup> Birthday, and then my father, Kelly, passed away only four days after my 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday. Leaving was even more bitter as it was just four days after his funeral, and there was even more reason to be with family.
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="text-girl no-bot-margined">
              One of the highlights of the holidays was going up to Nelson and Wellington to spend time with our friends and for James to get to know my side of the family more! We walked around Lower Hutt visiting each of my relatives, went out for dinner, spent time with my cousins, and had a great time!

              With some careful planning, Laura thought that I was going on a snowboarding trip for two days, and then flying home on December 23. Being "out of contact" for that time, I managed to get home on December 20 instead, without Laura suspecting a thing.

              <p align="justify" class="text-girl">
              He made fake sign up sheets for the trip and had the office lady email them to me long before he was due home! He planned four surprises for me while he was away, on the third friday of each month, and had me go to four different locations to find gifts that he had sent ahead. For the last surprise, he had me go to the botanical gardens, to the raised hill surrounded by trees, to find a book which was "our story" that he had made by hand.

              <p align="justify">
              I had placed my four used plane tickets in the back of the book with each word "will you marry me" written on the back so that there could me no mistakes. She took a while to figure out that the tickets were used, which gave me just enough time to sneak up behind her with the ring in my back pocket! I will never forget the look on her face when she turned around and saw me, and how good it was to hold her in my arms again!
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="text-girl">
              At first I couldn't believe he was there, in my arms, and I could not stop asking "how are you here" over and over as he just stood there smiling. But before he doing any explaining, he got down on one knee, and asked me a fairly important question!
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="no-bot-margined">
              She said yes! After that I tried explaining my way out of the web of lies that I had been spinning for the last year, which was quite entertaining. For the next three weeks we were on top of the world, enjoying Christmas and New Years together before just squeezing in the engagment party the night before I left!

              At our church camp in 2012, James became camp director after his dad, Kelly, volunteered and then opted out after he was called away on work out of the city. James had a lot to be organise, and as there were very few youth at camp, I was practically obligated to spend most of the camp helping him out!
              </p>
              <p align="justify"> 
              Laura put her hand up to organise babysitting for the weekend, and helped me make the weekend run smoothly in general, and sparks began to fly. I managed to secure the seat next to her during the studies, and she even shared my hymnal! We shared many amusing moments over the weekend, such as hiding the short supply of Marmite up in the rafters, Laura detecting my sunscreen fragrance from the other side of the field, and staying up playing table tennis!
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="text-girl no-bot-margined">
              After camp, at the youth group Bible study Sunday evening, I threw a little line that I was hoping James would catch despite being a guy, wondering "if there was anyone who could pick me up from school before the games night" that Wednesday night! He came through like a champion, offering to help out!

              After my birthday party on August 10, I had only two days left in the country before leaving for nine long months apart! I managed to land on my feet in New Haven, CT and survived the first year of graduate school through many long skype calls and the wonderful love and support that I was shown at Westminster OPC!
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="text-girl">
              It was a long hard slog, with James not coming home for Christmas or New Years, and after only four months of being together, but it was definitely worth it when he arrived back home at the end of May 2013 for a three month internship over the "summer" holidays! 
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="no-bot-margined">
              During that time, Laura matured into a young woman, and set the example with her patience and love, sending me messages, emails, and actual letters every month without fail! We had spent more time apart than together when I returned, and now we will have to wait until marriage to change that!

              And it was back to long distance on August 28, but this time round the transition was easier, as we knew what to expect and I had flights booked to come home at Christmas! Even though Laura didn't know that when I booked the flights at the start of the year she received a slightly different version of the travel documents that I did!

              <p align="justify" class="text-girl no-bot-margined">
              We both found it harder than last time overall, because growing so close over the past three months meant that we missed each other much more intensely, and more often as well. I finished school while James was away, and so we had more time to skype which was good! We enjoyed doing a weekly Bible study using the book "Gospel Treason" by Brad Bigney, and were reminded to rely on God for our love and our hope, even as we are now!

I am so incredibly thankful that Laura and I have been brought together by God, provided with the patience and the strength to spend only 10 of the then 27 months together before getting married, and to have the years ahead to make up for that! We are totally getting married!

That said, given that Laura just talked to you, you probably know everything there is to know about our story anyway. Hopefully we still have a few secrets up our sleeves that will be interesting!

              First of all, we got to know each other when Laura started coming to youth group events and Bible studies after her dad, Andre, moved to Christchurch and became our minister at Dovedale in 2008. James acted as chauffeur on a regular basis, and we spent much time talking and laughing over long car rides! Even before we started going out we did enough together to make the Reformed rumour mill.
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="text-girl no-bot-margined"> 
              James taught me how to solve the rubix cube, how to shoot a rifle without actually killing anything, and he came along to most of my singing performances at school. You could say that we were a couple ready for the picking when church camp came along, almost two years ago!

              <p align="justify" class="text-girl">
              At our church camp in 2012, James became camp director after his dad, Kelly, volunteered and then opted out after he was called away on work out of the city. James had a lot to be organise, and as there were very few youth at camp, I was practically obligated to spend most of the camp helping him out!
              </p>
              <p align="justify"> 
              Laura put her hand up to organise babysitting for the weekend, and helped me make the weekend run smoothly in general, and sparks began to fly. I managed to secure the seat next to her during the studies, and she even shared my hymnal! We shared many amusing moments over the weekend, such as hiding the short supply of Marmite up in the rafters, Laura detecting my sunscreen fragrance from the other side of the field, and staying up playing table tennis!
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="text-girl no-bot-margined">
              After camp, at the youth group Bible study Sunday evening, I threw a little line that I was hoping James would catch despite being a guy, wondering "if there was anyone who could pick me up from school before the games night" that Wednesday night! He came through like a champion, offering to help out!

            <div class="text-box">
              <p align="justify">
              Laura was the only girl who ended up staying the night at the boys flat as the other girls went home after the boys started gaming on the computers. I felt that it was my real call of duty to make sure that she was not bored, and so I stopped playing Call of Duty early in the night and played cards with Laura and a few others before helping her with the dishes. We talked for several hours, and as I was five months away from departing for the US, she shared her experiences and memories with me from when she staying over there while Andre was at seminary.

              <p align="justify" class="text-girl no-bot-margined"> 
              After bunking on the couches in the dining room, with a glass door between us and the gamers, we talked a bit more before saying goodnight! Not long after that James finally worked up the courage to say "well, I think we both know that we like each other, and..." the next morning he was talking to my dad, who invited him over for dinner the following night! Having the parental permission desired, we decided to go for it and use the remaining four months to get to know each other before James took off for Yale Graduate School.

              <p align="justify">
              After my birthday party on August 10, I had only two days left in the country before leaving for nine long months apart! I managed to land on my feet in New Haven, CT and survived the first year of graduate school through many long skype calls and the wonderful love and support that I was shown at Westminster OPC!
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="text-girl">
              It was a long hard slog, with James not coming home for Christmas or New Years, and after only four months of being together, but it was definitely worth it when he arrived back home at the end of May 2013 for a three month internship over the "summer" holidays! 
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="no-bot-margined">
              During that time, Laura matured into a young woman, and set the example with her patience and love, sending me messages, emails, and actual letters every month without fail! We had spent more time apart than together when I returned, and now we will have to wait until marriage to change that!
              </p>

              <p align="justify" class="text-girl">
              Even though three months didn't sound that long, being together was something else and we spent many hours talking and spending time with friends and family. Outside of school and work we had many adventures, with our family moving for two months for earthquake repairs and James working with his brother, Alan, and with many youth group events and outings as well!
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
              Not everything was light hearted, however, as during those months Laura's nana, Ali, passed away on her 18<sup>th</sup> Birthday, and then my father, Kelly, passed away only four days after my 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday. Leaving was even more bitter as it was just four days after his funeral, and there was even more reason to be with family.
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="text-girl no-bot-margined">
              One of the highlights of the holidays was going up to Nelson and Wellington to spend time with our friends and for James to get to know my side of the family more! We walked around Lower Hutt visiting each of my relatives, went out for dinner, spent time with my cousins, and had a great time!

              <p align="justify">
              And it was back to long distance on August 28, but this time round the transition was easier, as we knew what to expect and I had flights booked to come home at Christmas! Even though Laura didn't know that when I booked the flights at the start of the year she received a slightly different version of the travel documents that I did!
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="text-girl no-bot-margined">
              We both found it harder than last time overall, because growing so close over the past three months meant that we missed each other much more intensely, and more often as well. I finished school while James was away, and so we had more time to skype which was good! We enjoyed doing a weekly Bible study using the book "Gospel Treason" by Brad Bigney, and were reminded to rely on God for our love and our hope, even as we are now!

              With some careful planning, Laura thought that I was going on a snowboarding trip for two days, and then flying home on December 23. Being "out of contact" for that time, I managed to get home on December 20 instead, without Laura suspecting a thing.

              <p align="justify" class="text-girl">
              He made fake sign up sheets for the trip and had the office lady email them to me long before he was due home! He planned four surprises for me while he was away, on the third friday of each month, and had me go to four different locations to find gifts that he had sent ahead. For the last surprise, he had me go to the botanical gardens, to the raised hill surrounded by trees, to find a book which was "our story" that he had made by hand.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
              I had placed my four used plane tickets in the back of the book with each word "will you marry me" written on the back so that there could me no mistakes. She took a while to figure out that the tickets were used, which gave me just enough time to sneak up behind her with the ring in my back pocket! I will never forget the look on her face when she turned around and saw me, and how good it was to hold her in my arms again!
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="text-girl">
              At first I couldn't believe he was there, in my arms, and I could not stop asking "how are you here" over and over as he just stood there smiling. But before he doing any explaining, he got down on one knee, and asked me a fairly important question!
              </p>
              <p align="justify" class="no-bot-margined">
              She said yes! After that I tried explaining my way out of the web of lies that I had been spinning for the last year, which was quite entertaining. For the next three weeks we were on top of the world, enjoying Christmas and New Years together before just squeezing in the engagment party the night before I left!

              Now I am back over in the US for another four months before we get married and I get started on my thesis, the first being far more exciting! I am so incredibly thankful that Laura and I have been brought together by God, provided with the patience and the strength to spend only 10 of the then 27 months together before getting married, and to have the years ahead to make up for that! We are totally getting married!
